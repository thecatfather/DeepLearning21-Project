# MixMatch: A Holistic Approach to Semi-Supervised Learning - A Replication


Semi supervised learning comes into the picture to take advantage of both supervised and unsupervised ML. MixMatch is a semi-supervised learning method that
is an extension to MixUp for supervised learning using both labeled and unlabeled
data. In this project the MixMatch algorithm is explored for the CIFAR-10 dataset.
To understand the components that contribute to the performance, an ablation study
is conducted. The results obtained indicates that MixMatch results in comparable
performance to a supervised model.
